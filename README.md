# Notes

We're going to need to do a lot of command line stuff, basically everything in this project. Tools we'll need to get used to/familiar:

- nmap
- https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest
- [Aircrack-ng](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/) - Set of tools for auditing wireless networks.
- [Kismet](https://kismetwireless.net/) - Wireless network detector, sniffer, and IDS.
- [Reaver](https://code.google.com/archive/p/reaver-wps) - Brute force attack against WiFi Protected Setup.
- [Wifite](https://github.com/derv82/wifite) - Automated wireless attack tool.
- [Sword - pentesting framework based on openwrt](https://www.slideshare.net/BilalBokhari1/sword-50946159)
- [Build something similar to this, but as a drone](http://www.minipwner.com/)
