        3.3. <u>Personal data collected.</u> Parrot Drones SAS will collect and process the serial number of the drone and the IP address of your mobile terminal when the drone is first connected with the Application. If relevant, Parrot Drones may also collect and process your GPS data in the event of a drone software crash.
        </p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">
        3.4. <u>Recipients of the data.</u> The data gathered by the Application is received solely by the Parrot Group. All the data collected through your use of the Application, including personal information, will be transferred, stored and processed on servers located in France and managed by an external provider of the Parrot Group. Parrot Drones shall ensure that suitable protective and confidentiality measures have been contractually put into operation in order to comply with the relevant legislation.

        <strong>4. </strong>
        <strong>COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF NON-PERSONAL DATA</strong>
        </p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">
        4.1 Parrot Drones also collects data for which the form does not allow a direct link to be made with a specific individual; this data is therefore considered by the applicable legislation to be non-personal. The applicable legislation allows non-personal data to be gathered, used, transferred and divulged for any purpose.  Purely by way of example, Parrot Drones may have reason to collect the version number of the firmware installed on and used to operate the drone. This information provides Parrot Drones with help on the use of its products and services. However, if Parrot Drones should associate non-personal data with personal data, the resulting combined data would be considered as data of a personal nature while the association remained and it would thus be subject to the conditions referred to in article 3 of the present conditions.

Facebook will pass the Information to Parrot Drones in order to evaluate the use of the Application, compile reports on the activity of the Application and provide other services relating to the activity of the Application.

        <p align="JUSTIFY">
        5.3. At Parrot Drones’ request, and in accordance with Facebook policy on the use of data, Facebook may cross-reference the Information with other data which it holds in order to put advertising material concerning Parrot products onto the Facebook accounts of users to whom it might be of interest. No personal data collected via the Facebook site will be passed on to Parrot Drones.
        </p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">
        5.4. App Events can be deactivated from the “Settings/Privacy/Advertising” menu of your iPhone or from the “Google Settings/Advertisements” menu of your
